# How to contribute

This project started as an attempt to extract the most clear and comprehensive state machine framework library
from the bigger [Zephyr][zephyr] project. To make it as easy as possible for you to
contribute and for me to keep an overview, here are a few guidelines which should help us avoid all kinds of unnecessary
work or disappointment. 

1. Respect style defined in `.clang-format` file. You should use `clang-format` tool after you have made changes and
would like to send them back as a PR

And of course, this document is subject to discussion, so please
[create an issue](https://github.com/vpetrigo/smf/issues) or a pull request if you find a way to improve it!
