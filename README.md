# State Machine Framework

-------------------------
This project is a fork of a library from [Zephyr][zephyr] project which is great to use as a standalone library
for making state machines easier and cleaner.

The `smf` library has one of the cleanest interface and it is quite easy to use.

This repository provides an integration for the CMake build system that allows to add the `smf` library
to your project without a headache.

# Documentation
